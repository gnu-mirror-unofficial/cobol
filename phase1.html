<H2>Phase One</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Phase One of the project was the creation of a proof-of-concept Cobol to C
translator.  This was implemented using the <A HREF="http://www.polhode.com/pccts.html">Purdue Compiler-Compiler Tool Set</A> (PCCTS).  Only a partial Cobol
grammar was completed, as it was realized that PCCTS was inadequate for the 
needs of the project.  The grammar implemented for Phase One also included 
many MicroFocus-COBOL-specific extensions, as that was the only documentation 
available at the time.
<P>Phase One was completed in December 1997.  <A HREF="phase2.html">Phase Two</A> is currently underway.

<P><A HREF="phase1/cobol2c.html">The alpha version of Phase One is available for perusal.</A>
