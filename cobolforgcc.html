<h1>COBOL For GCC, a GNU Project</h1>

COBOL for GCC is a project to create a COBOL 85 compliant compiler for
GNU/Linux and other operating systems, using the GCC (GNU Compiler
Collection) code generation framework . Also included within the
source code are two sample compiler front ends to GCC (exa and toy).

</ul>

<h2>History</h2>

<P>Work commenced March 1999. To date we have written about 74,000
lines of code and 12,000 lines of documentation for the project. The
compiler is not yet at the stage where it is a useful tool. However
all the difficult technical problems are solved and adding extra
function is now relatively easy.

<p>At the moment the objective is to get a subset of COBOL implemented
which will allow much of the rest of the compiler and runtime routines
to be written in this subset of COBOL - rather than in C. So COBOL
programmers will be able to help with the project.

<h2>Status - completed work</h2>

<ul>

<li>The preprocessor which processes the full COPY and REPLACE
including as an extension nested COPY with REPLACING, as well as
continuation lines, fixed/variable length lines etc.

<br>
<br>
<li>Various utilities such as ASCII to EBCDIC, fixed to variable
length conversion, untabifying files.

<br>
<br>
<li>A grammar for the complete COBOL 85 nucleus. This includes all
the fudges needed to allow an LALR(1) parser like bison to parse the
COBOL nucleus. The nucleus is most of the language except for IO,
Report Writer, Sort Merge and Debug. 

<br>
<br>
<li>Integration into GCC the GNU Compiler Collection which allows for
multiplatform code generation, including a test suite, integration
into the GCC makefiles, and support for the GCC driver to orchestrate
the preprocessor and main compiler. None of the other free COBOL
projects are integrated into GCC so far.

<br>
<br>
<li>Implementation of a small subset of COBOL, consisting of
working storage with non-numeric literals, and all of the COBOL 2002
integral data types (binary-char binary-short binary-long and also
binary-long-long) and structures, redefines, occurs, pointers and
parts of the set verb and the display and stop run verbs in the
procedure division, also compute, goto including goto depending on,
Currently working on IF.

<br>
<li>Significant parts of the runtime have been done. See the source
forge task lists for details.

<br>
<br>
<li>At the moment we only generate code for a very small subset of
COBOL but now we have overcome all the hurdles this subset should grow
rapidly.

</ul>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>COBOL for GCC manual. 

<p>The manual includes the chapter <A
HREF="http://cobolforgcc.sourceforge.net/cobol_14.html">Writing
a Compiler Front End</a>, written originally by Joachim Nadler and
translated from German and extended by me. This chapter explains how
to write a compiler front end to GCC in 513 not-so-easy steps.

<h2>Source Code</h2>

File modules from early in the project are available to download from 
<A href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/CobolForGCC/">SourceForge Project Main Page for this project</a>

<p>An easy way to look at the source code is to browse the CVS
repository. A link to this is available from the main project links
page above or directly at

<A
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cobolforgcc/">Source
Code (cvs) Browsing</A>

<p>You can also check out (download) the source code anonymously using
cvs, which is available for Unix and for Windows.  Use the following
commands:
<br>
<br>cd directory_to_put_source (preferably with nothing else in it)
<br>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.CobolForGCC.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/CobolForGCC login
<br>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.CobolForGCC.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/CobolForGCC co .
<br>
<br>The password is nothing ie just hit return when it asks for the
password. Don't forget the "." as the checkout directory ID at the
end.  

<p>Subsequently you can refresh the source with 

<br>cd directory_to_put_source
<br>cvs update

<p>A daily tar file of the project is also available at 
<A
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/CobolForGCC-cvsroot.tar.gz">Source
Code tarball (use tar -xzf to unpack; most recent zip programs should be able to unpack them also)</A>

<h2>Other Free COBOL projects and other related Links.</h2>

<p>The Tiny COBOL project is currently quite active. It started mid
1999 using a pre-existing DOS COBOL compiler as a base. They are
generating X86 assembler for GNU/Linux. They have considerable
functionality and several developers. They are not taking a very
strict approach to adherence to the COBOL standard.
