COBOL to C Translator

OVERVIEW
       This project has concerned itself with translating COBOL to C.  
       COBOL, though widely used, has not had much success with free 
       software products which interpret, compile, or translate its 
       source code.  We believe this is due to the difficultly associated 
       with creating a parser for the language.  In order to address 
       the lack of free translators or compilers, we have written a COBOL 
       to C translator.  


GRAMMAR, PARSING, AND EMITTED CODE
       The structure of the translator revolves around three components.
       First, the parser is generated by PCCTS from the grammar description 
       files.   Second, the symbol table, which allows for storing 
       declared variables and related information required by the parser 
       for type checking.  Finally, the emitter creates the appropriate
       translation.

       The emitter is based on the individual COBOL statements, and the
       types of variables being operated on.  For instance, all operations
       on numeric data have the final result truncated to the appropriate
       length depending on the picture definition of the variable.

       The grammar is defined in the pseudo-EBNF syntax of the Purdue 
       Compiler Construction Tool Set (PCCTS).

       The C code is emitted by a set of specialized functions which 
       are called by the grammar actions.  The code is emitted directly
       into the output file.  No external libraries are used except the 
       standard C libraries.  Such a library may be part of the next 
       release.

       This translator produces ANSI C code which compiles with no
       warnings under gcc with the -Wall option turned on.  All 
       operations are checked for bad values and exit before causing 
       a segmentation fault, bus error, or other abnormal end.

       We parse all of the identification division, all but one section
       of the environment division, the data division, and the procedure 
       division.  All statements which are parsed but not implemented 
       will display a warning when translating and are ignored.

       We handle all control structures present in COBOL, pre- and 
       post- test loops, if-then-else, and function calls.

       All structures are handled, including filler elements.  However,
       level numbers 66, 77, and 88 are not implemented.  All variables 
       are translated with the appropriate type and initial value.

       We do not include obsolete constructions.  For example, the STOP
       statement used to allow for "pausing" the program by calling "STOP 
       string_literal".

HP-UX 10.  
If you get it to
work on anything else, please let us know.  Please see the README for
information on installing.<P>
This is a work in progress, so bug reports, gripes, etc, are all more
than welcome.<P>
A Cobol compiler is an official GNU project, but the code here is NOT
part of an official release.<P>
