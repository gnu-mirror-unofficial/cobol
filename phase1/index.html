<h3>Status</h3>
Since this is a project being worked on in free time, progress is sporatic.
I anticipate much more work to be done this summer, at least on my end. :)
<P>
The minimal Cobol to C translator is mainly the result of a semester project
but we are taking what was learned and starting with a better idea of the
problem at hand.
<P>
We have an EBNF grammar which is being verified for correctness/completeness
and several approaches are being considered for the translation to the
intermediate representation needed by most back-ends.
<P>
Research into ISAM files, database interaction, and various dialects of 
COBOL are areas which will require work once the main compiler is finished.
<P>
<h3>Cobol 2 C</h3>
<a href="cobol2c.html">The alpha of Cobol2C is available.</a>

<h3>All Help Welcome!</h3>
COBOL is big.  There are over 300 reserved words, numerous revisions and
incompatible "standards", and convenient "compiler dependent" behaviour.
Did I mention that COBOL is big and a pain?  But, there is great demand for
a free COBOL.  I want to see this thing work, but we need more than just
a few people tossing ideas out.
<P>
If you want to help try to pick an area of the construction that interests 
you.  So far, we have
	<ul>
	<li>Grammar Construction and verification
	<li>Semantics and translation to intermediate representation
	<li>General backend issues (also connected with IR people)
	<li>Configuration and documentation (makefiles and docs)
	<li>If you can think of an area I left out, let me know!
	</ul>
Then mail me with the area you want to work on, and/or mail the person
responsible for that area.
<P>
Cheers!
