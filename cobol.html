<H1>Cobol For GCC - a GNU project - Free Software Foundation</H1>

<H2>Objective</H2> 

<P>COBOL For GCC is a project to produce a free COBOL compiler
compliant with the COBOL 85 Standard, integrated into the GNU Compiler
Collection (GCC).

<H2>Status</H2> 

<P>74,000 lines of code since March 1999; all the COBOL preprocessing
is done and tested (COPY/REPLACE/line continuations etc). Parsing and
lexical analysis for the COBOL nucleus done. Integration into GCC has
been done, including integration into the GCC code generation back
end. Limited code generation via GCC back end has been done including
most of the data division. Some of the runtime routines have been
done. We estimate another 75,000 lines of code remain to be written.

<p>The purpose of this project is to allow the many millions of COBOL
programmers to bring their experience and talent to the world of free
software development.

<p>The plan is to get a subset of COBOL going which will enable COBOL
programmers to then help with the rest of the project, as well as C
programmers.

<H2>More Information</H2>

<P>The project is currently hosted at sourceforge. You can browse or
download the source and generated documentation by following this link
<A HREF="cobolforgcc.html">COBOL
for GCC project</A>.
<p>The project lead is Tim Josling (<A
HREF="mailto:tej@melbpc.org.au"><EM>tej@melbpc.org.au</EM></A>).

<H2>How you can help</H2>

<P>The main need is for people with C skills to write runtime routines
eg sort/merge. Contact the project via the link below and we can
arrange for a task large or small, simple to extremely complex,
depending on the time and experience you can bring to bear on the
project.

<H2>Other Free COBOL Projects</H2>

<p><A HREF="http://tiny-cobol.sourceforge.net/">Tiny COBOL project</A>
is quite active. It started mid 1999 using a pre-existing
DOS COBOL compiler as a base. They are generating X86 assembler for
GNU/Linux. They have considerable functionality and several
developers. They are not taking a very strict approach to adherence to
the COBOL standard.

<BR> 

<p><A HREF="http://web.tiscalinet.it/albertosantini/cobcy/">Alberto
Santini's COBOL Compiler COBCY</A> is currently inactive. The function
is fairly limited.

<br>

<p><A HREF="http://www.lusars.net/gnu-cobol/">Cobol2C</A> is currently
inactive. They did two versions of COBOL compilers, both with limited
function. This was previously the 'GNU COBOL' project.
